# Unexpected Behavior with Null-Aware Operator in Dart

This example demonstrates a common misconception regarding null safety and the null-aware operator (`??`) in Dart.  The code appears to handle null values correctly, but it has subtle unexpected behavior that can lead to bugs.

## The Issue
The use of `?? 0` inside the getter `value` provides a default value of 0 if `_value` is null. Although this seems harmless, it means that each instance of `MyClass` maintains its own default value, leading to confusion if the instance is later used.  When using `null`, unexpected behavior might not always show. However, if you use different types, or a class that has methods, the unexpected behavior will be more easily spotted.

## Solution
The better way is to use `late` variable to explicitly indicate that the value will be assigned later.

## How to Reproduce
1. Copy the code in `bug.dart`
2. Run the code. Note the output of the example code.
3. Look at the improved code in `bugSolution.dart`.
4. Run the improved code. Compare the output to the original.
